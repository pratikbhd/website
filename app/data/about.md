#### Introduction
I am a second-year Master's student at the University of Arizona in the Computer Science department. I am currently a Research Assistant at the department, working with the [delphi](https://github.com/ml4ai/delphi) team under the [AutoMATES](https://github.com/ml4ai/automates) project.
<br>
I will graduating on May 2020 and am actively looking for full-time opportunities. My primary areas of interest lie in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Computer Security.

#### Currently
As a Research Assistant working as part of a cross-departmental project, I have garnered both technical and managerial skills that are essential in the tech industry. Building on top of two years as a developer after my undergraduate, I have learned how to combine individual research with teamwork, working together with various teams to build large projects while striving to look for new and innovative ways to solve exciting problems in web security and programming languages, among others.

#### Some History

- I did my pre-school in Kolkata, India at Swarup's Junior School.

- After my pre-school, my family shifted back to Nepal where I studied at Galaxy Public School, Kathmandu till early high school (Grade 10).

- I completed the rest of high school (Grade 11 and 12) at Trinity International College, Kathmandu, Nepal.

- After high school, I joined Pulchowk Campus for a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering. I stood 5th nationwide among 15000+ applicants during the entrance examination.

- Early in college, I had been exploring my interest in the field of computer science. It was also then when I was taking up photography. These two interests resulted in me being excited about computer vision and image processing.

- Throughout the four years of my Bachelor's degree, I stood first each year in my department, receiving the Ncell Excellence Scholarship award each year.

- One of my most heart-warming multi-cultural experience was in 2015, when I was selected among 15 students from Nepal to travel on an 11-day cultural exchange program to Japan.

- After the devastating earthquakes in 2015, I volunteered at Will, an organization founded by students from Pulchowk Campus. For two months we traveled to worst affected areas of Nepal, delivering food, clearing out rubble and building temporary shelters. It was a humbling as well as a heartbreaking experience but it also made me realize my passion for working in areas of social welfare in the future.

- In 2015-2016, I worked as a media and communication manager, playing a core role in organizing multiple TEDx events in Lalitpur. This boosted my confidence in terms of team management as well brought forth my love for networking with people.

- After my undergraduate, I worked at two of the most prestigious IT companies in Nepal, this experience not only helped me improve my technical skills but also familiarise myself with all stages of the product development life cycle and different aspects of software development.
