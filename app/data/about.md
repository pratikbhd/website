As a Research Assistant working as part of a cross-departmental project, I have garnered both technical and managerial skills that are essential in the tech industry. Building on top of two years as a developer after my undergraduate, I have learned how to combine individual research with teamwork, working together with various teams to build large projects while striving to look for new and innovative ways to solve exciting problems in web security and programming languages, among others.

#### Some History

- I did my pre-school in Kolkata, India at Swarup's Junior School.

- After my pre-school, I came back to my home country, Nepal where I studied at Galaxy Public School, Kathmandu till early high school (Grade 10).

- I completed the rest of high school (Grade 11 and 12) at Trinity International College, Kathmandu, Nepal.

- The summer between Grade 10 and 11, I spent all day playing GTA Vice City. One of my first proud achievement was getting to 100% completion on that game. I guess this is when my love for gaming started.

- I started taking pictures with my Canon Powershot digital camera. I have been fascinated with photography with since then. Nowadays I shoot with my Nikon D5200 whenever I get the time to.

- After high school, I joined Pulchowk Campus for a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering. I stood 5th nationwide among 15000+ applicants on the entrace examination for that years enrollment season.

- Throughout the four years of my Bachelor's degree, I stood first each year in my department, receiving the Ncell Excellence Scholarship award each year.

- In 2015, I was selected among 15 students from Nepal to travel on a 11-day cultural exchange program to Japan.

- After the devastating earthquakes in 2015, I volunteered at Will, an organization founded by students from Pulchowk Campus. For two months we travelled to the worst affected areas of Nepal, delivering food, clearing out rubble and building temporary shelters.

- In 2015-2016, I workied as a Media Manager at various TEDx events in Lalitpur. My love for networking with people started during this time.
